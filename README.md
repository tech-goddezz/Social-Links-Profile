## My process

### Built with

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* CSS custom properties
* Flexbox
* Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I reinforced my understanding of **Flexbox** and how to align and space elements effectively. One key learning was how to ensure all buttons have equal width and height regardless of text length, which I solved by setting fixed widths and using flex properties.

I also practiced hover states and improved my ability to structure small, reusable components inside a card layout.

```css
.socials button {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 12px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  font-weight: 600;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus more on:

* Accessibility (e.g., better alt text, focus outlines, ARIA labels).
* More advanced responsive layouts using CSS Grid.
* Adding subtle animations or transitions for smoother hover effects.

### Useful resources

* [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - Helped me solidify my knowledge of flexbox alignment.
* [Frontend Mentor Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/community) - Great place to ask questions and see how others solved the challenge.
